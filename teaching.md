## Vision for Teaching

As a teacher of literature, and specifically Latin American literature, I have the unique responsibility to not only impart material, 
but to introduce students to voices and cultures that are often not their own. To undertake this task, I approach my teaching with four 
principle objectives: (1) to help my students develop close reading skills that will make them more attentive and curious readers of 
literature; (2) to hone their ability to write effectively and articulate complex ideas in English and Spanish; (3) to arm them with 
hermeneutic tools that will facilitate a deeper understanding of texts and cultures; and (4) to foster a relationship with literary 
works that, in addition to leaving space for enjoyment of literature, cultivates an appreciation of the ways in which aesthetics and 
literary form and content enable new means of understanding and engaging with the world.
