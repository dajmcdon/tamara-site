_UBC Public Humanities Hub Launch [Event](https://www.arts.ubc.ca/news/ubc-public-humanities-hub-launches-to-help-scholars-share-expertise-on-urgent-societal-issues/), March 2020._

<!--["Better Living Through the Humanities:](https://www.facebook.com/crres.iub/videos/vb.619227484774796/1862208990476633/?type=2&theater) Engaged Research, Public Scholarship, and Social Action Today," 
the keynote address by [Dr. Marcia Chatelain](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RhMmAAK/marcia-chatelain) at the 2018 CRRES Graduate Student Research Symposium.
As the Graduate Research Assistant (2016-2018) for Indiana University's Center for Research on Race and Ethnicity in Society ([CRRES](http://crres.indiana.edu)), 
I organized the 2018 Graduate Student Research Symposium, which featured Dr. Marcia Chatelain of Georgetown University as keynote speaker (click on above link for video of the keynote address). 
During my two years with CRRES, I helped to expand the Center's programming by applying for grants to fund the Center's Speaker Series and 
Social Media Internship, organizing talks by two poet laureates (Juan Felipe Herrera and Tracy K. Smith), and launching the CRRES Undergraduate 
Mentorship Program.-->
