excerpt: A post written with the other half of my two-body problem.

Oh, the dreaded two-body problem. 

When I started my Ph.D. in 2012, a professor in Religious Studies joked that if she could give a single piece of advice to new students, it'd be not to fall in love with a fellow academic wannabe. Having an academic as a partner often involves significant compromise when it comes to one or both of your careers or a shared sacrifice of not living in close proximity during the academic year.

Well, much to the chagrin of my friend in Religious Studies, I fell for a fellow academic, a professor in the Statistics Department (note: we met on OkCupid, not in class, so no weird student-prof vibes here), and we had to navigate the two-body problem starting in the final two years of my doctoral studies. Our situation was different than the norm, as we weren't two students seeking academic jobs at the same time, but rather one student and a professor, in two very different fields. We'll share some of the wisdom we gained here. 

July 1, 2020 was the first day of my partner's job at UBC.
