I specialize in 20th- and 21st-century Mexican and Central American narrative fiction, as well as in broad comparative areas 
that reach into other disciplines and traditions: Latina/o Studies, critical theory, political philosophy, and border and 
diaspora studies. My research is animated by questions of political agency, economic precarity, and the violence that obtains 
throughout waning national modernity, as well as by the ways in which literature shapes, critiques, and indexes burgeoning 
neoliberal globalization.

My dissertation analyzed the novels of Chilean-Mexican-Catalunyan author Roberto Bolaño and Honduran-Salvadoran-US-Latino 
author Horacio Castellanos Moya as a means of conceptualizing the rise of what I call "post-national literature," which refers 
to literary works that comment on and critique, both formally and thematically, the shifting dynamics of the 
nation state as neoliberal globalization becomes the dominant ordering system of world relations. To do this, I analyzed 
these authors' engagements with literary and aesthetic traditions, particularly realism and the avant-garde, to demonstrate that 
a dialectic emerges between their works and the literary past that opens a space to interrogate the place of 
aesthetic praxis as neoliberal globalization becomes ascendant. Finally, I examined Bolaño’s and Castellanos Moya’s literary rejections of Leftist militant reason and discussed how their novels implicate the Left in the rise of neoliberal globalization. 

My current book project, _Narrative in Crisis, Narrative on Crisis: Greater Mexican and Central American Literature in the Age of Neoliberal Globalization_, examines contemporary novels that represent and respond to disparate crises of the present epoch. In it, I read late-20th and 21st-century Mexican and Central American narrative fiction—produced both domestically and in the diaspora—to two ends. First, I attend to the ways in which, with a distinctly neoliberal aesthetic, each work meditates on and denaturalizes the logic of economic crisis. Second, I situate each novel in relation to the literary tradition that precedes it, and I consider how political and economic crisis is accompanied by a related literary crisis. To this end, _Narrative in/on Crisis_ asks: If the novel is the genre par excellence of national modernity, what becomes of this literary form as neoliberal economic relations come to replace the nation state? In different ways, each of the novels that I examine poses this question, narrating not only the economic and biopolitical crises of the neoliberal present, but also recognizing their own state as works in crisis. I read novels by Roberto Bolaño, Laury Leite, Valeria Luiselli, Horacio Castellanos Moya, Eduardo Halfon, and Claudia Hernández as post-national _narratives in crisis_, and I attend to the ways in which politics, economics, ethics, and aesthetics become entangled in these works. Along the way, my project engages with diverse theoretical perspectives, such as Critical Race Theory, Migration and Diaspora Studies, and Sound Studies.

I am working on a second book project, tentatively titled _Latin American Literary Soundscapes in the Capitalocene_, that considers how contemporary authors deploy sound in narrative fiction as a means of critiquing and responding to exclusionary politics, economic inequalities, and ecological devastation of the neoliberal present.
